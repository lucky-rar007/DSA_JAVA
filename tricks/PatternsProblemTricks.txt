Patterns need nested loops.
Outer loop is for rows .
inner loop is for colums.

Outer loop is for lines(rows).

For the inner loop , focus on the columns and somehow connect them to the outer loop .
    PRINT IN THE OUTER LOOP ONLY .

Observe symmetry in some patterns (optional , required in some only)


Outer loop → decides the ROW (line number)
Inner loop → decides WHAT and HOW MUCH to print in that row
Print newline → after inner loop finishes

row=context and column=content

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {          // rows
    for (int j = 0; j < something; j++) {  // columns
        System.out.print("x");
    }
    System.out.println();             // move to next row
}
