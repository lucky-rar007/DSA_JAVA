Patterns need nested loops.
Outer loop is for rows .
inner loop is for colums.

Outer loop is for lines(rows).

For the inner loop , focus on the columns and somehow connect them to the outer loop .
    PRINT IN THE OUTER LOOP ONLY .

Observe symmetry in some patterns (optional , required in some only)
